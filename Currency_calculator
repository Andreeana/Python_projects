#I just got home from a fun trip to South America, specifically Colombia, Peru, and Brazil. There's some leftover cash in:
#ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡´ Colombian pesos
#ğŸ‡µğŸ‡ª Peruvian soles
#ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡· Brazilian reais
#I created a program that asks the user for the amount they have in pesos, soles, and reais and calculates the total in USD.

pesos = float(input("What do I have left in pesos?"))
soles = float(input("What do I have left in soles?"))
reais = float(input("What do I have left in reais?"))
total_usd = pesos *  0.049 + soles * 0.28 + reais * 0.17
print("The total is:", total_usd)
